Preparing for the Future of Work: Critical Abilities and Traits for Cyber Employees

The cyber-security field is of growing importance due to an increased reliance on technology brought on by the Internet of Things. In this work, we investigated the abilities and traits important for the selection of cyber-security employees. We utilized job analysis information from a literature review and subject matter expert (SME) interviews to identify 38 abilities and 24 traits important for selection. We then used hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) on SME ratings of the abilities and traits to reduce the dimensionality and determine which are most critical for selection. This project contains the R code and data we used for HCA.
